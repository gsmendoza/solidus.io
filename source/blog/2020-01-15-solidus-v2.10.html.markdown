### What's changed?

The full CHANGELOG can be found on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
but here's a list of all major changes:

**Added support for Rails 6**

Solidus core now fully supports Rails 6! After upgrading to the 2.10 version
you can follow the official [Rails Upgrading Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-2-to-rails-6-0).
Please note that Rails 6 requires Ruby 2.5.0 or newer.

- Add support for Rails 6 [#3236](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3236) ([aldesantis](https://github.com/aldesantis))
- Fix dummy app generator to skip Bootsnap and Webpack in Rails 6 [#3327](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3327) ([aldesantis](https://github.com/aldesantis))
- Handle deprecation for Rails 6 in DummyApp [#3352](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3352) ([cedum](https://github.com/cedum))

**Deprecated support for Rails 5.1**

Rails 5.1 is deprecated and we'll remove support for 5.1 on the next version.
If you are still using it, a deprecation warning will be printed in your logs
when the application boots.

- Deprecate Rails 5.1 [#3333](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3333) ([kennyadsl](https://github.com/kennyadsl))

**Changed default images sizes**

We update the images used by Solidus demo in the `sample` gem. To update
those images we needed to change the default sizes of Spree::Image. They
changed from:

```
mini: '48x48>', small: '100x100>', product: '240x240>', large: '600x600>'
```

to

```
mini: '48x48>', small: '400x400>', product: '680x680>', large: '1200x1200>'
```

If your store relies on these sizes, you should change them back following
the guide [here](https://legacy-guides.solidus.io/developers/products-and-variants/product-images.html#paperclip-settings).

- Upload new sample images [#3270](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3270) ([mfrecchiami](https://github.com/mfrecchiami))
- Remove unused sample images [#3397](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3397) ([JDutil](https://github.com/JDutil))
- Update sample imgs with wrong file extension [#3343](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3343) ([mfrecchiami](https://github.com/mfrecchiami))

**State machines extracted into their own replaceable modules**

This allows stores to replace the state machine completely with their own
implementation, even with different gems or using custom code without any
state machine gem. All the customizations previously made to the state machine
should work smoothly, but it could be a good idea to check twice. You can read
more about the suggested way to customize the state machine [here](https://legacy-guides.solidus.io/developers/customizations/state-machines.html#state-machines).

- Extract the state machines into replaceable modules [#3356](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3356) ([cedum](https://github.com/cedum))

**Display error if editing non-current order**

In Solidus frontend users were able to input any `order_id` in the
`/orders/:order_id/edit` route and they were simply seeing the cart
(showing the current order and not the requested one) without any notice.
With this Solidus version we print an flash message and redirect users to
their cart.

- Display error if editing non-current order [#3391](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3391) ([JDutil](https://github.com/JDutil))

**Solidus now requires Ruby 2.4 or newer**

Ruby 2.2 and 2.3 support has ended, Rubocop support for 2.2 ended and
they are also about to drop 2.3. Also, we already introduced code that
is not compliant with 2.2 anymore.

- Bump required ruby version to 2.4 [#3337](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3337) ([kennyadsl](https://github.com/kennyadsl))
