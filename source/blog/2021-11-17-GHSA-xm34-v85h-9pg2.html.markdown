We've released `solidus_auth_devise` [2.5.4](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise/releases/tag/v2.5.4) to address a security vulnerability (GHSA-xm34-v85h-9pg2) affecting all versions of `solidus_auth_devise`.

We've also released Solidus [3.1.3](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/releases/tag/v3.1.3), [3.0.3](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/releases/tag/v3.0.3) and [2.11.12](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/releases/tag/v2.11.12). They just contain a patch in case you're unable to update `solidus_auth_devise`.

You can read about GHSA-xm34-v85h-9pg2 on the [solidus mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/solidus-security).
